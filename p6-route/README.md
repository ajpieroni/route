Route

This project implements a routing service that represents the United States highway network as a graph and calculates routes and distances on this network. At a high level, I implemented `GraphProcessor` which stores a graph representation and provides public methods to answer connectivity, distance, and pathfinding queries. 

I also implemented a `main` method in `GraphProcessor` that produces a minimal viable product (also known as MVP) demonstrating the functionality of `GraphProcessor` and visualizing the results.
